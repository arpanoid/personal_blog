## Book Summary: Talking to Strangers

Software construction, or any knowledge work which involves formulating something concrete out of loosely defined abstract ideas, is perhaps the most difficult endeavour for a software team. Most of the times, the final product fails to deliver and the scope creeps are frequent because a squad including product owner, software developers and everyone, thinks they understood what this user aka complete stranger wants but rarely is the case.

Here is the famous quote from Steve Jobs which precisely captures this sentiment.  

> “Some people say, "Give the customers what they want." But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'" People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.”

We think that a customer wants “A faster horse” with six legs, blue color, and capable of having multiple riders but you would need someone like Henry Ford to actually realize customers are not asking for a horse at all.

Most of the software projects fail, often over budget, under-delivered because of the following reasons.

* Communication failure between different teams
* Bad formal, non-formal and functional requirements
* Unrealistic time frame and almost non-existent risk analysis 
* Toxic top level management which treats software developers as disposable assets, leading to sweatshop-like environments.  

Now before reading “Talking to Stranger”, I thought them root causes but now I understand that these are just the symptoms. The reality is that “talking to a stranger” is a complex task. Software design is more dependent on human behavioral psychology than fancy tools or languages. 

## Truth default theory

“Talk to Strangers” basically argues that humans are terrible at judging strangers and due to evolutionary reasons, we mostly default to the truth. In the book, he describes an experiment where students were asked to fill out a questionnaire and half way through, the experimenter left the room deliberately leaving the answer sheet there for them to cheat. Later they asked the candidates whether they cheated or not. 

Although the experiment was not about cheating but if we can figure out if they’re lying or not just by interacting with them. The video of the interview was shown to a series of control groups which involved normal citizens and law enforcement officers from Police, FBI etc. It turns out, the average detection ratio was only 54%. Which means we, including law enforcement officers, are no better at detecting the lie than just a random coin toss. 

This also sheds some light on why we always default to truth and believes that we got the perfect requirements. That a junior developer has figured out all the unknowns and a feature will be delivered in this sprint. That product owner really does know about the value proposition of that shiny new feature is. Because we as humans are hardwired to trust each other. There was an evolutionary advantage in that. 

There also a case of arrest and subsequent suicide of Sandra Bland, which is a prime example of totally different communication styles between a complete strangers and how the whole system which suppose to protect the people like Sandra Bland completely fails them. 

Every sentence that comes out of our mouth is just the tip of the iceberg. We all have our own context about the world around us, our own cultural and other biases and many other hidden subconscious thought patterns that affect our decision making. 

The author really argues that we can’t really do anything about this as “Default to truth” is our auto pilot mode. Also just about doubting everyone can lead to a disastrous result of us, to an organization and to society in general.  

The best We, as knowledge workers, can do is to be aware of this limitation and leverage that into risk analysis. Perhaps ask better questions and be cognizant about definitive answers we get. Ultimately it all boils down to creating something of a value. And the better we understand that software development is a value creation endeavour for a stranger, the better we can formulate our plan, gather better requirements and keep the uncertainty under that tab. 

## Transparency and Coupling 

The other two major themes touched by Malcom Gladwell are transparency and theory of coupling. Certain teams and managers put an oversized emphasis on face to face communication. Now don’t get me wrong, talking to someone in person has a lot more benefits than merely talking to them over the phone. But even that is not a fully transparent mode of communication. In his book, author highlights the case of Amanda Knox and issues with transparency. How different things and different expressions mean differently in various cultures. In today’s diverse workplace, this can not be more true. If that is the case, aren’t we doing the disservice by being not as flexible with the work environment than we should be ?  Or is there a principle of coupling at play ? 


Author argues that sometimes there is coupling between place and a psychological trigger. The famous example is suicide and golden gate bridge. That people who were suicidal didn't commit suicide once they were removed from their trigger, Golden gate bridge. There was also the incidence of suicide as a product of intention in combination with context. In 1962, the famous poet Sylvia Plath committed suicide, like many of her English countrymen using lethal gas in her oven. By the the time the gas was phased out, the number of total suicides, not just suicide by gas, had plummeted. As if suicides were coupled in that way.  

Perhaps is that reason some people are more productive in office environment and can’t get work done in their comfy pajamas at home ? And some type of personalities prefer their cozy non-distracting basement over chatty office space ?

Ultimately we’re going through a massive work from home experience right now during a global pandemic so We’ll probably have more data to figure this out. 

## Conclusion

Ultimately, we all are a lump of chemical sitting on a rock roaming around aimlessly in the universe. Evolution has prepared us to save ourselves from a tiger attack or to forage and hunt in nature. Because of our psychological and behavioural limitations, there will always be challenges between human interactions. Especially magnified in a fluid task like software development. But at least understanding it gives us tools and thinking patterns to fight it and minimize its impact. At the end, we're all talking to a stranger. For me, even at times when I talk to myself.

###### P.S. For those who are interested. This is my high level notes for this book. 

It’s a book about assumptions and mistakes we make about people we don’t know 
In this book, he goes over the communication breakdown between strangers.
* The arrest and subsequent death of Sandra Bland
* Navile Chamberlain’s failure to find out the true intentions about Hitler
* The cuban mole in DIA, also termed as queen of Cuba - Ana Montes. She was a very high ranking official and despite enough signs, the intelligence community failed to figure out the truth .
* Bernie Madoff scandal. How SEC failed to see all the red flags.
* Jerry Sandusky scandal
* Trial of Amanda Knox
* Kansas city police experiment.

Three main psychological theory at play here

* Truth default theory. Why human beings are more trusting of strangers than distrusting. 
 * Not defaulting to truth default theory may be disastrous 
 * We should rather accept our limitation 
* Issue with transparency 
* Idea of coupling. 
 * Sometimes two things are coupled together. For example, Golden gate bridge and suicide.
